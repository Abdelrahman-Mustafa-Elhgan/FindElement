# FindElement
A simple C++ program that performs linear search to find an element in a static array.

# 🔎 FindElement – Simple Linear Search in C++

A lightweight and beginner-friendly C++ console application that allows users to search for a specific number inside a static array using the linear search algorithm.

This project is perfect for beginners learning arrays, loops, conditionals, and basic algorithm design in C++.

## ✅ Features

- 🔐 **User Input System**  
  Prompts the user to enter the target element to search for.

- 🧮 **Linear Search Algorithm**  
  Sequentially scans the array to find a matching element.

- 📌 **Index Reporting**  
  Displays the index of the found element, or a "not found" message.

- 💬 **Clear Console Output**  
  Provides intuitive and beginner-friendly feedback messages.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Interface:** Console-based  
- **Concepts:** Arrays, for loops, conditionals, basic I/O

## 🎯 Use Cases

- C++ learners practicing:
  - Searching algorithms
  - Working with arrays
  - User interaction via console
  - Conditional logic

- Simple CLI tools for quick data lookups


## 📌 Future Improvements

- Allow searching in a dynamically sized array  
- Accept user input to fill the array  
- Add support for searching multiple occurrences  
- Export search result to a file
